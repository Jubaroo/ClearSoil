# ClearSoil

This is a server mod for Wurm Unlimited and requires Ago's Server Modloader available at:
  https://github.com/ago1024/WurmServerModLauncher
  
  The Clear Soil mod adds two actions 'Clear Soil' and 'Lower Tile'.

  Clear Soil will allow a player to dig all four corners of their current tile down by one dirt level at the same time.
  The digging action will continue to work on dirt/sand covered corners even after one or more corners have struck rock.
  
  The 'Lower Tile' action works on the same principle except works on rock tiles.
  
  there is a configurable 'minimum' skill required for each action, Digging for Clear Soil and Mining for Lower Tile.
